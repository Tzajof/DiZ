<h1>DiZ Documentation: Index</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is the index of documentation for the DiZ library. There are various sections to the DiZ documentation: <br />
<ul>
    <li><a href="Pages/diz_graphics_index.htm">Diz Graphics</a></li>
    <li>DiZ Sound</li>
    <li>DiZ Objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
DiZ is a (currently) Windows-only utility library that covers fundamental tasks such as the creation and handling of OpenGL graphics windows,
OpenAL sound objects and other useful things. It is by no means a "professional" library; it is simply developed along the way as I come
across tasks that I would consider suiting to the project, that I then add into the library.<br /><br />

The project could be ported to Linux (and maybe even Mac) in the future but these are not quite possible at the present moment. Generally
speaking, DiZ is created for my own ease of use, and although I'm happy for other people to use it, this has not been its main purpose so
far.<br /><br />

However, I hope you find some use for the DiZ library- I've been happy to have it around myself, and I'd love to expand it further in the
future and maybe even take it so far as an open-source project.<br /><br />
