This folder should contain most of the libraries/headers required to successfully build DiZ.

I can't guarantee there won't be any difficulties though! There's every chance it could take some tinkering
to get everything building smoothly.

I must also stress that you should have the DirectX SDK installed if you want to use the DirectX capabilities.
The headers/libraries themselves MAY not work right out of the box!
